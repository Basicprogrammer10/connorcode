# Zork Review — Connor S

## Introduction

**Zork** is an early *text based adventure* game released in *1977* to the **PDP-10**. It was created by *Tim Anderson*, *Marc Blank*, *Bruce Daniels*, and *Dave Lebling* who were members of the **MIT Dynamic Modelling Group**. 

Zork is split into three games: **Zork:** The Great Underground Empire – Part I , **Zork II:** The Wizard of Frobozz, and **Zork III:** The Dungeon Master

## Storyline

The **story** of Zork takes place in “*the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground*”. The objective is to explore and collect treasures in order to complete the adventures and become the *dungeon master*. In **Zork I** you start as an *adventurer* near a white house in a clearing. You are left to explore the world and find the treasures hidden within it.

## Gameplay / Mechanics

**Zork** is a text based game and it has no graphics, because of this the game is played using **commands**. This does not make the game play less fun, in fact it makes the game more fun because their is more of a mystery.  For example you can use `north`, `south`, `east` and `west` to move throughout the world. Although it can sometimes feel like you are stuck in a dead end, I think the game is still *very* fun because you have to figure out how to escape and continue on your adventure. Zork also has a high **replay value** because you can try to beat the game with less moves or in less time.

When playing, it is possible to acquire items such as weapons, food, tools as well as other useful things and store them in your **inventory** for later use.  Your inventory can only hold so many things so you may need to drop some throughout the game in order to make space for other items.

During your journey is is possible to die from monsters such as the **grue**. On death you will *respawn* but your items will be scattered throughout the map adding incentive not to die.

## Scoring Mechanics

In Zork you need *350* **points** to win. Points can be collected by picking items up and more can be earned by putting them your case.  You can also earn points by exploring and entering new rooms. Points are given as these tasks are completed but they are *never* taken away.

To **win** the game you must have all 350 points and have placed all treasures in the trophy case. Once you do this you will earn the rank of *master adventurer* and a map will appear in the case. The map will lead to the Stone Barrow, *the end of* **Zork I** and the beginning of Zork II.
