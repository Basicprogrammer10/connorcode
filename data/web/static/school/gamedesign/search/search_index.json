It will be a Procedurally generated Adventure game with bosses to fight and loot to collect. You will start playing by creating your character . You will then explore the Procedurally generated world to collect loot and level up. Tools I am using many tools to create Eacloxus this includes: G develop for creating the main game layout Visual Studio Code for being the best text editor Adobe Illustrator creating menu layouts Electron-builder for compiling the code JavaScript for some game programming NodeJS for running the JavaScript on a computer Python for the auth server code FFmpeg for converting media files GIT for Version control And some less important others I learned how to use most of these tools in the past for other random projects. I usually did this by using my previous knowledge mixed with many DuckDuckGo searches. Design Document There was a design document that I assume was intended to aid the game creation process however I feel that it has not been as useful as I hoped. Progress So far I have created a main page and options page for the game. The main page has the options for starting the game , going to the options menu and quitting the program. There is a Minecraft inspired random splash and some user auth to insure the internal release of the 'game' can only be played by cretin users. There is also some snazzy background music! The options page has some options... and by clicking then you can toggle their values. (There is not much to say about this) More Screenshots I thought that I would have made more progress by now. I thought that I would have made more progress with the actual game. Challenges I had many challenges with this game so far, one of these challenges is that in the beginning I was unsure how to access variables in g develop with inline JavaScript. I eventually learned how to do this after reverse engineering the game engine a bit. Final code: Other For next week I hope to have a game that allows you to pick a character and move it around.

It is an Adventure game with bosses to fight and loot to collect . You start by spawning inside your house, once you spawn in you are let to read the backstory of your town. You can explore the world , talk to characters , collect loot and level up . What has been done... Throughout the class my partner and I have done a lot on this class, much of which have proved helpful in the creation of this game. We played games like Minecraft and Zork , this was done to learn more about game design! While we worked on this game my partner learned about Programming, Functions, Variables, Game design, Creating Storylines and much more . We also made use of the iterative design process by continuing to modify and add to the game. This has proven to work well in the creation of games by allowing us to see past the finish line and to keep trying to improve our skills and our game! This process has also showed us how difficult and time-consuming it can be to create video games (especially with Makecode) . Before this the amount of time and energy needed to create advanced video games wasn't as clear. The part of this design process that was the most rewarding and enjoyable was when you finally get to play a working version of your game after hours of work. Progress We have made sooo much progress in many ways from when we started on this project. We have improved our knowledge in programming, art, and much more. We have also learned how to more effectively work in a team environment . However, even with all of these successes we still faced many challenges, some examples of this includes: The game code not functioning as intended Having trouble with character design Increasing replay value (Has been fixed by introducing a game timer) Feedback has helped us in many ways one of which is to help us understand how new players understand the game and how we can improve it . The fixes implemented because of this feedback let new players have a bettor understanding the game. Being made aware of these issues has greatly improved the end product of the game because it tells us what we need to work on. The Future..? This has been an amazing, fun and very educational experience and both my partner and I have learned so much . But there is still so much to learn ! We both plan to continue working our games and start new projects! Other So now we will talk about some less important yet still interesting things. My partner and I both created our own versions of the game. My version of the game was a program that runs on your PC however it sadly never got finished ... Because of that we decided to put more effort in to my partners version and to submit that... Not sure if you care, but I have all the code and assets for my version on GitHub Here .

It was created by Tim Anderson , Marc Blank , Bruce Daniels , and Dave Lebling who were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group . Zork is split into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire \u2013 Part I , Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master Storyline The story of Zork takes place in \u201c the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground \u201d. The objective is to explore and collect treasures in order to complete the adventures and become the dungeon master . In Zork I you start as an adventurer near a white house in a clearing. You are left to explore the world and find the treasures hidden within it. Gameplay / Mechanics Zork is a text based game and it has no graphics, because of this the game is played using commands . This does not make the game play less fun, in fact it makes the game more fun because their is more of a mystery. For example you can use north , south , east and west to move throughout the world. Although it can sometimes feel like you are stuck in a dead end, I think the game is still very fun because you have to figure out how to escape and continue on your adventure. Zork also has a high replay value because you can try to beat the game with less moves or in less time. When playing, it is possible to acquire items such as weapons, food, tools as well as other useful things and store them in your inventory for later use. Your inventory can only hold so many things so you may need to drop some throughout the game in order to make space for other items. During your journey is is possible to die from monsters such as the grue . On death you will respawn but your items will be scattered throughout the map adding incentive not to die. Scoring Mechanics In Zork you need 350 points to win. Points can be collected by picking items up and more can be earned by putting them your case. You can also earn points by exploring and entering new rooms. Points are given as these tasks are completed but they are never taken away. To win the game you must have all 350 points and have placed all treasures in the trophy case. Once you do this you will earn the rank of master adventurer and a map will appear in the case. The map will lead to the Stone Barrow, the end of Zork I and the beginning of Zork II. Educational Value? Zork could be used to teach people about the history of computer games. When playing Zork, players also develop strategy and problem solving skills.","title":"Zork"},{"location":"zork/#zork-review-connor-s","text":"","title":"Zork Review \u2014 Connor S"},{"location":"zork/#introduction","text":"Zork is an early text based adventure game released in 1977 to the PDP-10 .
