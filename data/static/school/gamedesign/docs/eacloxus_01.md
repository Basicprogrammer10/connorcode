# Eacloxus Reflection 1 â€” Connor S

## The Idea

The end goal of this project is to have a game called **Eacloxus**. It will be a **Procedurally generated Adventure** game with bosses to fight and loot to collect. You will start playing by **creating your character**. You will then explore the Procedurally generated world to collect loot and level up.

## Tools

I am using many tools to create **Eacloxus** this includes:</br>

- **G develop** for creating the main game layout</br>
- **Visual Studio Code** for being the best text editor</br>
- **Adobe Illustrator** creating menu layouts</br>
- **Electron-builder** for compiling the code</br>
- **JavaScript** for some game programming</br>
- **NodeJS** for running the JavaScript on a computer</br>
- **Python** for the auth server code</br>
- **FFmpeg** for converting media files</br>
- **GIT** for Version control</br>
- And some less important others</br>

I **learned** how to use most of these tools in the past for other random projects. I usually did this by using my previous knowledge mixed with many DuckDuckGo searches.

## Design Document

There was a **design document** that I assume was intended to aid the game creation process however I feel that it has not been as useful as I hoped.

# Progress

So far **I** have created a **main page** and **options page** for the game. The main page has the options for **starting the game**, going to the **options menu** and **quitting** the program. There is a Minecraft inspired **random splash** and some **user auth** to insure the internal release of the 'game' can only be played by cretin users. There is also some *snazzy* background music!

The **options page** has some options... and by clicking then you can toggle their values. (There is not much to say about this)

I thought that I would have made more progress by now. I thought that I would have made more progress with the actual game.

## Challenges

I had many challenges with this game so far, one of these challenges is that in the beginning I was unsure how to access variables in g develop with inline JavaScript. I eventually learned how to do this after reverse engineering the game engine a bit. <br/> Final code:

## Other

For next week I hope to have a game that allows you to pick a character and move it around. This will be the beginning of the actual game.

Not sure if you care but I have all of the code and assets on GitHub [Here](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/Eacloxus).
