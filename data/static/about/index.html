          <h2>ðŸŒˆ About Me</h2>
          <span id="greeting">Hello</span>, I'm Connor Slade. I am just some
          random kid with way too much free time. Anyway, welcome to my website
          <a href="https://connorcode.com">connorcode.com</a>
          <em>V{{VERSION}}</em>! <br /><br />
          I'm interested in Photography, Software development and
          <em>some</em> Web development. <span strike>My favorite</span> The
          Best programming language is
          <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>! Like just look at the
          cute <a href="https://rustacean.dev/">mascot</a>. I use it for most of
          my projects. In fact, I'm hosting this site with my dependency free
          web server framework
          <a href="https://crates.io/crates/afire">afire</a>. <br />
          <br />
          I started my <em>programming journey</em> around 2014 with C++ on the
          <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>. Then I learned how to
          make basic websites with HTML and CSS, and then how to make it
          interactive with JavaScript. After that, I learn Python and eventually
          started to learn much more including Docker, NodeJS, Nim, Assembly,
          C#, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Lua and of course <em>Rust</em>. It turns out,
          after getting the fundamentals picking up other languages is not too
          hard ðŸ™‚.
          <h2>ðŸ˜Ž Interesting Projects</h2>
          Now onto some of my more interesting projects! My first
          <em>real</em> WebApp was my
          <a href="https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/WebChecklist"
            >WebChecklist</a
          >. It is a realtime WebSocket based Checklist System made with Node
          JS. <br />
          <br />
          Using what I learned from that I made my
          <a href="https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/WaterTemp"
            >Water Temperature Monitor</a
          >. This was a intresting project because It combined a hardware
          monitoring system with a website and API. The hardware part consisted
          of a raspberry pi connected to a temperature sensor, using the
          âœ¨<em>magic</em>âœ¨ of rust it logged the temperature and ran the
          internal API. The Web server would stream the real-time temperature
          and the client would display the incoming data as a graph. I actually
          made a Build guide for an inscrutable contest
          <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Water-Temperature-Monitor/"
            >here</a
          >. <br />
          <br />
          My next project is kinda a long story but basically the
          <em>garbage</em> management system my school district uses has a very
          simple problem that allowed large amounts of login attempts to be
          made. apparently they don't know what a rate limit isâ€¦ Being the
          <em>good<sup>1</sup></em> person that I am I wrote a
          <a href="https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/SchoolPasswordCrack"
            >whole document</a
          >
          Explaining the problem and how to fix it. Naturally they didn't do
          anything. But I did develop my Rust <em>skilz</em> with the CLI tool I
          made. <br />
          <br />
          This next this may be my favorite project so far! Its my web server
          framework <a href="https://crates.io/crates/afire">afire</a>! Its written in rust and I made it to learn about HTTP. I have been working on it every so oftan since createing it adding new feature like Path Params, Advansed Middleware.
